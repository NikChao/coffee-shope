## Creating a component/util
- from the root dir run `yarn create-component <name> --typescript`
- from the root dir run `yarn bootstrap` to bootstrap dependencies
- you're good to go!
- when you're done, to publish run `yarn publish-all` which will publish your new package + update any packages that may reference it as a dependency
